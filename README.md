hi everyone
Farida ,s ATM Machine
It sounds like you're excited about the ATM machine developed by Farida 
using TypeScript! TypeScript is a popular programming language that offers 
static typing capabilities for JavaScript, making it easier to catch errors 
and write more reliable code. Farida's use of TypeScript likely enhances the 
robustness and maintainability of the ATM machine's software. Exciting times ahead!
